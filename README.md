# sunce

A high-performance command-line solar position calculator.

This is an emerging Rust port of [solarpos](https://github.com/klausbrunner/solarpos), aiming to provide identical functionality for calculating topocentric solar coordinates and sunrise/sunset times.

## Status

**Alpha / heavy development** - Basic sunrise/sunset functionality is working, but many features are still being implemented.
